<h1>The Best Movies According to Mateo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h2>The Amazing Spider-man</h2>
<p>I loved Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-man.</p>
<h2>Avengers Infinity war pt.1&2</h2>
<p>Seeing all the superheros from the comics so well depicted made these movies too good.</p>
<h2>Ready Player One</h2>
<p>In my opinion probably one of the better foreshadowing of what we think our futures may look like.</p>
